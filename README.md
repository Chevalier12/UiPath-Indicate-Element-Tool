# UiPath-Indicate-Element-Tool

This tool is a quicker implementation of the **Indicate On Screen** activity in UiPath Studio.

# What it can do?

It invokes the **Indicate On Screen** activity and returns the selector, afterwards you are prompted to either add attributes, remove attributes, or leave the selector as is, then the selector is copied in your clipboard with the proper '"'s so it becomes an easy copy-paste.
